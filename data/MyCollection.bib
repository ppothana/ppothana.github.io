abstract = {With the significant potential of Unmanned Aircraft Vehicles (UAVs) extending throughout various fields and industries, their proliferation raises concerns regarding potential risks within the national airspace system (NAS). To enhance the safe and efficient integration of UAVs into airport environments, this paper presents an analysis of temporal statistical patterns in flight traffic, the predictive modeling of future traffic trends using machine learning, and the identification of optimal time windows for UAV operations within airports. The framework was developed using historical Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADS-B) data obtained from the OpenSky Network. Historical flight data from Class B, C, and D airports in California are processed, and statistical analysis is carried out to identify temporal variations in flight traffic, including daily, weekly, and seasonal trends. A recurrent neural network (RNN) model incorporating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture is developed to forecast future flight counts based on historical patterns, achieving mean absolute error (MAE) values of 4.52, 2.13, and 0.87 for Class B, C, and D airports, respectively. The statistical analysis findings highlight distinct traffic patterns across airport classes, emphasizing the practicality of utilizing ADS-B data for UAV flight scheduling to minimize conflicts with manned aircraft. Additionally, the study explores the influence of external factors, including weather conditions and dataset limitations on prediction accuracy. By integrating machine learning with real-time ADS-B data, this research provides a framework for optimizing UAV operations, supporting airspace management and improving regulatory compliance for safe UAV integration into controlled airspace.},

abstract = {Cybersickness remains a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of virtual reality (VR) technology. Traditional methods for predicting cybersickness rely on self-reported questionnaires or physiological signals from specialized sensors, which have their limitations. This study explores the potential of using real-time, easily acquired head-tracking data (HTD) from standard VR headsets as a scalable alternative for estimating cybersickness. Twelve participants engaged in a VR session using an Oculus Quest 2 headset while their HTD were recorded. Kinematic metrics such as linear and angular velocity, acceleration, and jerk were computed from the HTD, including positional and angular parameters. Participants' cybersickness levels were assessed using the Virtual Reality Sickness Questionnaire. While exploratory data analysis revealed no significant direct correlation between individual kinematic variables and cybersickness scores, machine learning models were employed to identify predictive patterns. Subsequently, four regression models, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machines, were trained and evaluated using the computed kinematic features to predict the cybersickness score. Among these, the Gradient Boosting model demonstrated superior performance, accurately predicting cybersickness scores with normalized differences less than 3.08% on unseen data. This approach offers a scalable and practical solution for real-time cybersickness prediction in VR applications and compliments other techniques that rely on physiological sensors, hardware, or user profiles.},

abstract = {Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing offers unprecedented opportunities for creating tailored materials with complex geometries. This study quantifies the impact of layer thickness and orientation on the mechanical and acoustic properties of SLA‐printed materials under triaxial stress conditions, a critical yet understudied area. We fabricated models with layer dip angles of 0°, 45°, and 90°, and layer thicknesses of 25, 100, and 160 $\mu$m. These samples underwent triaxial compression testing and ultrasonic elastic wave velocity measurements using an Autolab 1500 triaxial load frame. Our findings reveal significant anisotropy in the mechanical properties of the 3D‐printed samples, with up to a 30% increase in uniaxial compressive strength for 45° oriented samples. Additionally, we uncover a novel relationship between layer parameters and acoustic properties, enabling nondestructive quality assessment of 3D‐printed components. This research provides a comprehensive framework for enhancing the performance of 3D‐printed materials in high‐stress applications, with critical insights into the behavior of SLA‐printed materials under complex stress states, useful for aerospace, geomechanics, and biomedical engineering applications.},

abstract = {Laminated rocks, prevalent in natural geological processes, exhibit pronounced mechanical anisotropy, a characteristic shared with unconventional hydrocarbon reservoirs. The arrangement of laminations significantly influences fluid flow and stress propagation, underscoring the imperative to comprehend the mechanical behavior of such materials. Traditional homogenization models and continuum-based numerical methods often struggle to accurately capture the intricate dynamics of granular materials, marked by variations and arching mechanisms crucial for system stability. In contrast, discrete element methods (DEM) offer a distinct advantage by considering heterogeneity and physical interactions at the level of individual grains. This study evaluates force and stress evolution in composite laminated rocks, employing digital representations of laminated materials with varying volume fractions of binary mixtures. Utilizing a particle flow code, we construct digital rock samples consisting of rigid grain assemblage and a flat joint contact model governing grain-to-grain contacts.Three digital rocks were first constructed: matrix, stiff material, and soft material. The stiff and soft materials are embedded into the matrix material, similar to laminated rock types. We then investigate the effect of relative lamina thickness and the angle of laminations with respect to loading directions. We observed that the number of laminations has little impact on the elastic stiffness and strength of the laminated rocks. The material exhibits higher effective stiffness when loaded parallel to the laminations, while stiffness is lower perpendicular to the laminations. The evolution of cracks proves intricate, reflecting a delicate interplay between material elastic constants, strength properties, and loading direction. We observed that the initiation and propagation of cracks show strong dependence on the angle of laminations and inclusion type. These findings contribute valuable insights into the mechanical behavior of laminated composite granular rocks.The effects of sedimentary processes, mineralogical differences and mechanical deformation result in the generation of various laminae within the Earth's crustal rocks. Anisotropic properties typically result from mineral alignment in metamorphic rocks, layering in sedimentary rocks, and discontinuities in the igneous rock mass (Chenevert and Gatlin, 1965; Williams, 1990). In geoengineering applications, the consideration of anisotropy is paramount. The geoengineering applications that encounter anisotropic rocks include drilling and hydraulic fracturing operations in thin-bedded, laminated shall sand hydrocarbon reservoirs, fractured basement rocks, shale layers, excavations, and geotechnical design of anisotropic rocks (Winhausen et al., 2023; Yan et al.; Ni et al., 2023). Applications in engineering that overlook how rocks behave differently in various directions can lead to errors of varying degrees, depending on the extent of the rock's anisotropy Amadei (1996).},

Traditional homogenization models and continuum mechanics-based numerical methods often fall short of accurately capturing the intricacies of granular materials. Granular materials exhibit heterogeneity and arching mechanisms governing the force networks that ensure system stability. Unlike continuum-based approaches, discrete element methods (DEM) have an advantage in assessing effective material properties by considering material heterogeneity and grain-level physical interactions. This study evaluates effective elastic properties using DEM with flat-joint contact law for composite binary mixtures with a stiff inclusion embedded within a matrix material. We examine variations in the elastic properties across different structural and laminated geometrical distributions of inclusion materials. Our findings closely adhere to the Voigt-Reuss and Hashin–Strikman bounds within their specific conditions, demonstrating the promising application of DEM in the analysis of composite materials. In addition, our research provides an in-depth analysis of the distinctive stress-evolution and damage-evolution characteristics exhibited by various geometrical configurations of inclusions under unconfined compressive loading. These results offer invaluable insights into the mechanical behavior of composite granular rocks and underscore the potential applications of DEM in addressing rock physics modeling problems encountered in petroleum engineering.},

abstract = {Stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing technology is increasingly applied in geomechanics, petroleum engineering, geothermal, and CO2 storage research, particularly in fracture flow and mechanics. To understand the mechanical characteristics of 3D printed materials, we conducted laboratory experiments examining the effect of printing orientation on the properties of three specimens. These specimens were printed using a FormLabs (3B+) 3D printer at layering angles of 0°, 45°, and 90°, with a resolution of 100$\mu$m, and sized 1-inch in diameter and 2-inches in length. We performed triaxial compressive tests, ultrasonic elastic wave velocity measurements, and unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests using an Autolab 1500 test frame. Incremental confining pressures from 1 MPa to 20 MPa were applied to explore static and dynamic mechanical properties. The UCS tests showed that all samples exhibited ductile behavior with similar stiffness and yield strength across different layering angles, demonstrating a stiffness of approximately 4 GPa and compressional wave velocities between 2555-2580 m/s at zero confining pressure. The findings confirm the mechanical and acoustic consistency of the samples, supporting their suitability for advanced geomechanical applications.Three-dimensional (3D) printing technology, also known as advanced manufacturing (AM), is a rapidly developing field that has revolutionized manufacturing processes across various industries including aerospace (Richter \\& Lipson, 2011), automotive (Rahim \\& Maidin, 2014), healthcare (Logan \\& Duddy, 1998), petroleum engineering (Li et al., 2021), and geomechanics (Phillips et al., 2021). This technology uses computer-aided design (CAD) to create three-dimensional objects by adding material layer by layer using almost any type of material such as polymers, and ceramics. Thermoplastic urethane and metals can also be employed as raw material (Gopinathan \\& Noh, 2018).There are several techniques involved in 3D printing, including Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM), Stereolithography (SLA), Selective Laser Sintering (SLS), Digital Light Processing (DLP), Binder Jetting, and Material Jetting. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages (Jandyal et al., 2022), and the choice of technique depends on the type of object being printed, the desired resolution, and the available materials. With the increasing popularity and availability of 3D printing technology, it is now relatively easy to create custom objects, prototypes, and even entire structures using 3D printing. Among the available techniques, SLA is known for producing high-resolution objects with smooth surfaces. SLA was first developed in the early 1980s by Kodama, 1981 and called Rapid Prototyping (RP).},
