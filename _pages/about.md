I am a petrophysicist on a journey that has taken me from the energy industry into academia. Currently working as a UAS Research Associate at the University of North Dakota, I bring with me a mix of practical experience and a growing academic foundation. I love teaching—it's both a way to learn and a way to share knowledge. I believe in teaching by involvement, where students engage actively with real-world problems. My aim is to contribute to geoscience research while supporting and inspiring the next generation of scientists.

My research centers on geomechanics and subsurface processes, particularly in areas like geological CO₂ storage, sustainable energy solutions, and hydrocarbon reservoirs. By combining hands-on experimental techniques with advanced numerical methods—such as discrete element modeling and Physics-Integrated Neural Networks—I strive to tackle complex geological challenges in ways that are both scientifically sound and practically useful.

Having spent over a decade in the energy industry, I’ve gained experience in petrophysical analysis, geomechanics, and geological modelling. These roles allowed me to work in a variety of settings, from offshore platforms to collaborative research environments, where I learned the value of teamwork, adaptability, and staying focused under pressure.

I’m constantly looking to learn and grow, and I enjoy finding intersections between geoscience and newer technologies like machine learning and data analytics. My involvement in federally funded projects and grant writing has reinforced my belief in the importance of collaboration for tackling some of the pressing energy and environmental challenges we face.

As a mentor and educator, I’m committed to creating a learning environment that encourages curiosity, practical problem-solving, and inclusivity. I believe mentorship and teamwork are vital for making meaningful contributions to research and for empowering others to succeed.
